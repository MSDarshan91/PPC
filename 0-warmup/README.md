# A warmup exercise: testing submission

First, complete the following simple tasks:

1. Edit the file `hello.cpp` and replace the value "MY_NAME" with your name.
2. Run `make` and ensure everything compiles properly. 
3. Execute `./hello > output.txt`.

Second, commit your changes and push them to your private repository:

1. Add your new file `git add output.txt`
2. Commit your changes `git commit .`
3. Push your changes to your own repository `git push`

Third, go to GitHub and ensure that your commits have been pushed:
